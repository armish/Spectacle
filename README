*****************************************

Spectacle is written in Java and based on the ChromHMM code. It has been tested on Linux and Windows. It extends "LearnModel", one of the top level commands of ChromHMM (http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM) by adding a spectral learning algorithm for Hidden Markov Model parameter estimation.
Other than "LearnModel", all other commands are run as described in the ChromHMM manual (http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/ChromHMM_manual.pdf).

E.g. java -jar Spectacle.jar MakeSegmentation model.txt SAMPLEDATA_HG19 OUTPUTSAMPLE_HG19


**OPTIONS**

For "LearnModel", if the option "-chromhmm" is shown, Spectacle is run exactly the same as ChromHMM as described in the ChromHMM manual. Otherwise, it is run using the spectral learning algorithm with the following options:

-lambda lambdavalue : The Lambda parameter in the data smoothing step is set as lambdavalue. lambdavalue=0.95 is the default.

-spectralrandom : The emission matrix is estimated as described in Appendix C in Hsu et al 2012. Without this option, the emission matrix is estimated using anchor observations as described in the paper (Song and Chen, 2014)


**EXAMPLES**
Here is some example how we run Spectacle.jar with Chip-seq data from ENCODE.

- Install Java 1.5 or later if not already installed.

- Download Spectacle.zip via "Download Zip" on the right side and unzip the file.

- Download Chip-seq data from ENCODE and put under the folder SAMPLEDATA_HG19.

hg19_cellmarkfiletable.txt contains the filenames that were downloaded.

- Binarize Bed files
java -jar Spectacle.jar BinarizeBed -peaks CHROMSIZES/hg19.txt SAMPLEDATA_HG19 hg19_cellmarkfiletable.txt SAMPLEDATA_HG19

hg19_inputfilelist.txt contains the filenames of the binarized data.
